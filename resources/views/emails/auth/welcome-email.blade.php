# Hi{{ $user->first_name }},

Welcome to Dropship Connect. We hope you are having a great day!

Now that you are registered, you can access your Dropship Connect dashboard. There’s not much to see until you are part
of a collaboration – we call it a colab.

The Colab is where the magic happens!

Inside a colab, you can see product listings and choose the actions that you want Dropship Connect to perform.


If you were invited to Dropship Connect by a partner, you are already part of a colab. To access the colab, click the
handshake icon on the left side of your screen.

OR

If you haven’t got a collaborator yet, then getting one on board is the first thing you should do.
- Click the handshake icon on the left of your screen.
- Click the ‘+’ button to create a new Colab
- Enter the email address of the retailer or supplier you wish to work with.

They will receive an invitation to Dropship Connect and can get started straight away.

If you need help, please reach out to us at help@dropshipconnect.co or use the yellow help beacon on the bottom right of
your [Dropship Connect dashboard](https://dropshipconnect.co).

Having trouble? Dropship Connect works best on a desktop or laptop computer; smartphone screens are too small for
Dropship Connect.

Have a great day!
